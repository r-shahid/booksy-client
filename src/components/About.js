				<div className='about-info'>
					<span>Booksy is the lovechild of a Trello board and Goodreads. </span>
					It's intended to serve as a book-tracking app where users can add
					books they want to read, books they're currently reading, and books
					they have read. New books are added to the left-most column and can be moved by clicking the button next to the trash icon. Once a book is moved into the "Read" list, users can
					add a rating.
					<br />
					I made Booksy because I'm an avid reader. Back when I did marketing for a publisher, I made a few friends in the industry, who kindly still send me books to review. That, paired with the fact that I'm constantly buying new books means that I always have a steady supply of unread books. Using an app like Booksy helps me keep track of everything on my shelf.

					<br />
					I'm an NYU graduate with a BA in Mathematics. From a young age, I
					always gravitated towards art and expression, whether thatâ€™s making my
					own art or experiencing that of others. When I'm not coding, I like to
					work across many mediums, from different kinds of paint to yarn and
					thread. Given the ongoing pandemic, I have been working through my
					yarn stash by knitting socks for myself and my family.

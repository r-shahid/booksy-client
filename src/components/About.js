					<span>Booksy is the lovechild of a Trello board and Goodreads.</span>{' '}
					It's intended to be used as a book-tracking app where users can add
					books they want to read, books they're currently reading, and books
					they have read. Once a book is moved into the "Read" list, users can
					add a rating.

					<br />
					I'm an NYU graduate with a BA in Mathematics. From a young age, I
					always gravitated towards art and expression, whether thatâ€™s making my
					own art or experiencing that of others. When I'm not coding, I like to
					work across many mediums, from different kinds of paint to yarn and
					thread. Given the ongoing pandemic, I have been working through my
					yarn stash by knitting socks for myself and my family.
